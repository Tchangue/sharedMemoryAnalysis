# Shared memory analysis
This project has to solve the problem of shared memory in computers. Nowadays we have computers with several CPU or one CPU with many cores 
and the goal of this project is just to create a system in form of a webpage with functions that indicate when a CPU can access the memory
and when not. 
The other problem to solve is also that all the CPUs (when we suppose that the computers has many CPs) must not have the same access rights
at the same moment in order to provide data consistency in the system.
You can have the overview of the main task through the following pictures.
